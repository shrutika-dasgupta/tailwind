                Much like the height lines your mom drew on the wall when you
                were a kid, itâ€™s fun and important to keep track of your
                Pinterest progress.

                <br><br><strong>Track how your
                followers, pins, repins and likes are growing over time</strong> and see
                how you stack up within your industry.
