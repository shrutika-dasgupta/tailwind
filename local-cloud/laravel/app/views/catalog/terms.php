            employer or client, “you” refers to the employer or client. If not, “you” refers to the

<p><strong><strong>WARNINGS OF SERIOUS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES<br>
            Warning: Under Section “15″ of these Terms of Use, if you engage in certain conduct,
            such as violating laws that regulate sending out and the content of bulk email,
            excessively engaging individuals on social networks who are not likely to be interested
            in your products, try to take advantage of us in violation of our Terms of Use by taking
            such actions as using our servers to host images for your website, instead of just
            emails you send using Tailwind, sending out emails created using Tailwind through
            another service or failing to pay an amount you owe us, we will be entitled to collect
            from you the higher of a pre-set amount or a multiple of your charges for one year on an
            annualized basis (which is a reasonable pre-estimate of the actual damages we would
            likely suffer from such conduct) plus attorney fees. We offer very powerful tools at a
            very low price. In exchange we expect our customers to act with integrity and follow our
            rules in order to help us maintain our reputation as having customers who only market to
            individuals likely to be interested in their services and only send bulk email to people
            who have consented to receiving them or with whom they have had a relationship from
            earlier selling or licensing (or negotiating to sell or license) a product or service
            and to not otherwise abuse our system.<br>

<h3 dir="ltr">Part 1</h3>

<p><strong><strong>(Applies to All Members of Tailwind)<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Who We Are : “Tailwind” is a trade name of BridesView, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, that
        owns and operates the website with the URL:
        <a href="http://www.tailwindapp.com/">http://www.tailwindapp.com</a> (the “Website”).
    </li>
    <li>Purpose : The purpose of these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”) is to set forth the terms and
        conditions under which you are permitted to use our social media marketing and
        email/electronic newsletter creation, distribution and management system (the “Services”).
        Any email, including but not limited to any email newsletters, sent out using the Services
        (or third party partner services we may contract with to execute the Services), are referred
        to herein as an “Email.” Any engagement, including but not limited to, following or
        messaging users through social networks, are referred to herein as “Social Media Marketing.”
    </li>
    <li>Changes : We reserve the right to change any of the terms of this Agreement by posting the
        revised Terms of Use on our Website and/or by sending an email to the last email address you
        have given to us. Unless the Term is terminated within ten (10) days, this new Agreement
        will be effective immediately with respect to any continued or new use of the Services.
    </li>
    <li>Eligibility : We require that any Member be at least eighteen (18) years of age. By using
        the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and
        that your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Your
        uploads may be deleted and your subscription may be terminated without warning, if we have
        reason to believe you are under eighteen (18) years of age.
    </li>
    <li>Charges and Payments :
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription Plans
                <ul>
                    <li>5.1 Our charges for subscription plans (monthly, quarterly, semiannual,
                        annual) are posted on our Website and may be changed from time-to-time.
                        Payments are due for the full period for which any part of the period is
                        included in the “Term.” Payments are due for any period on the same date, or
                        the closest date in that month, to the date of the month you signed up with
                        us and made your first payment (the “Pay Date”). For any period for which
                        you have already paid, for which you increase your service level causing you
                        to go to another pricing level, except as otherwise provided in this
                        Agreement, you will be required to pay at the higher level on or before the
                        Pay Date for the following period. If the Term ends before such payment is
                        due, you will still be required to make one payment at the higher level.
                    </li>
                    <li>5.2 As long as you are a Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you
                        agree to at all times provide us with valid credit card information or valid
                        authenticated PayPal account and authorize us to deduct the period charges
                        against such credit card or PayPal account and to replace the information
                        for any credit card that expires with information on a different valid
                        credit card or PayPal account. Any individual using a credit card represents
                        and warrants that he or she is authorized to use such credit card and that
                        any and all charges may be billed to such credit card and will not be
                        rejected.
                    </li>
                    <li>5.3 Whenever you increase your service level so that you are at a more
                        expensive level, we may, at our sole discretion, require you to pay the
                        difference in the subscription payment before the Services are delivered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Pay-as-You-Go-Plans
                <ul>
                    <li>5.4 You may elect to buy credits to use our Services if such option is
                        presented on our website, rather than sign up for a subscription plan. If
                        you elect a “Pay-as-You-Go Plan,” you will still be considered a “Member”
                        and all the terms of this Agreement will still apply to you other than the
                        requirement that you pay us by subscription period.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Refunds
                <ul>
                    <li>5.5 We are required to provide a refund only if we terminate our Services to
                        you without cause before the end of a period for which you have paid. There
                        is no other circumstance in which you will be entitled to a refund from us.
                        We may, at our sole discretion, offer refunds in other situations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Term, Termination and Removal : Either party may terminate the Term of this Agreement at any
        time for any reason by providing Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Services to
        you at any time with or without cause. We will refund a pro rata portion of your monthly
        prepayment or reimburse you for unused credits if we terminate you without cause. We will
        not refund and/or reimburse you in such manner, if there is cause, such as your using our
        system to send bulk Emails to people with whom your relationship does not meet the
        requirements of 11(b) below. Once terminated, we may remove any of your data, images,
        electronic newsletters or other emails and related data and files from our Website and any
        other storage. Additionally, if you do not log in to your account for 12 or more months, we
        may, at our sole discretion, deem your account “inactive” and permanently delete your
        account and all data associated with it.
    </li>
    <li>Account and Password : You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any
        account name and password provided to you. You are solely responsible for uses of any
        account provided to you, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify
        us of any unauthorized use of any account of yours.
    </li>
    <li>Proprietary Rights Owned by Us : You acknowledge that we, or our suppliers, own all
        proprietary rights in the Website and the software used to provide the Services, including,

        proprietary rights in that content (or have been given a valid license from the owner of the
        proprietary rights in such content) and have obtained releases for all related privacy and
        publicity rights.
    </li>

                services to users on your E-mail or User lists. We do reserve the right to send
                messages related to executing or improving the Services. For example, we may send an

                and other marketing material based on data related to the performance of the
                Services, provided such data is aggregated or anonymized in a way that does not
                threaten user privacy.
            </li>
            <li>Any data collected related to your brand or users from publicly available sources or

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Anti-Spam and Abuse Related Rules : You agree to the following:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><strong>a. Definition of SPAM: We have adopted the definition of Spam set forth on the
            Spamhaus website at <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/definition.html">http://www.spamhaus.org/definition.html</a>
            The first line of the Spamhaus definition reads:<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The word “Spam” as applied to Email means Unsolicited Bulk Email (“UBE”).</li>
    <li>It is a concern to us if you use Tailwind to send any unsolicited email to anyone with whom
        you have no relationship. It is much more of a concern, and more likely to cause our system
        to be blocked by various ISP’s or third party service providers, for you to send an
        unsolicited email to an entire list of people you don’t know.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>b. Permission Lists Only: You may use Tailwind only to send Emails or Social
            Media Marketing to individuals and entities that either:<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Possibility 1 – Consent Obtained
        <ul>
            <li>A. gave or give you written (including electronic) permission to send Emails or
                Social Media Marketing to them, without subsequently withdrawing such permission and
                either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Consent Given Recently gave you the permission within the prior 12 months;
                        or
                    </li>
                    <li>Consent Given More Than One Year Earlier you sent them a promotional email
                        or social media marketing message, which was not objected to, within the
                        prior 12 months; or
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Possibility 2 – Sold or Negotiated to Sell Product or Service
        <ul>
            <li>B. gave or give you their name and email address in connection with their purchase,
                or negotiations to purchase, a product or service from you, have not opted out from
                receiving your emails and either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Recent Sale or Negotiation such sale or negotiations occurred within the
                        previous 12 months; or
                    </li>
                    <li>Sale or Negotiation Occurred More than One Year Earlier you sent them a
                        promotional email or social media marketing message, which was not objected
                        to, within the prior 12 months.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you send Emails or Social Media Marketing to a list, and you get an unusual
                amount of SPAM complaints (more than 1 out of 1,000), ISPs will begin blocking
                future emails from your company. They will also request (that’s putting it mildly)
                that Tailwind shut down your account. So if you don’t have proof that each
                recipient on your list has opted-in to receive your emails, or otherwise meets the
                above requirements, don’t provide them to or import them into Tailwind.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>c. Requirements: You agree that you will use:<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>No purchased lists (no matter how expensive).</li>
            <li>No rented lists (even if they “opted in”).</li>
            <li>No 3rd party lists whatsoever.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should only use Tailwind to send Social Media Marketing, newsletters, updates, and
        promotions to people who specifically requested email from you, or otherwise meet the
        requirements of 11(b) above.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>d. We’re In This Thing Together: We do what we can to keep our system clean, but
            you agree to pitch in too. Here’s how:<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sending your first campaign to an old list? Many recipients won’t remember you, and will
        report you for spamming. Do everything in your power to remind them of who you are, and how
        they got on your list.
    </li>
    <li>Clean your customer list before you import. Take out any addresses older than 6 months. Bad
        addresses lead to bouncebacks. Too many bouncebacks, and ISPs block Tailwind (and you).
        We’ll shut your account down if you import an old list that gets too many bounces.
    </li>
    <li>Don’t just import your entire Outlook Address Book. Export them into a spreadsheet, then
        take some time to clean out bad addresses (like Sales@Mailchimp.com, or Support@Google.com).
        If you import even one address by mistake, that person can get you blacklisted and shut
        down.
    </li>
    <li>Importing from a CRM? Break it into separate segments or interest groups so you can send
        relevant content to your customers. Don’t just mix a bunch of different lists together and
        send one “blast” to all of them.
    </li>
    <li>Sending on behalf of a client? Educate your client about responsible email marketing.
        They’re depending on you to be the expert. Here are some email marketing resources for you.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>e. CRM, Salesforce, and API Imported Lists: CRM tools are great for maintaining
            relationships with prospects and leads, then converting them into paying customers. Or
            just nurturing your customer relationships. But CRM tools are built for one-to-one
            communication. Email marketing tools like Tailwind are built for one-to-many
            communication. They are not the same. Spam laws apply when you do one-to-many email
            marketing.<br>
        </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Before importing any list into Tailwind from your CRM or any other database you maintain,
        understand our permission-lists-only rules. Remove any prospects or leads who did not
        explicitly request email marketing from you or otherwise meet the requirements of 11(b)
        above. Even if you’re sending email marketing to customers who have consented to receive
        your Email, you are still required, under applicable law, to allow them to opt-out of your
        email marketing list (you may need to turn that feature ON in your CRM tool). The simple
        fact that a recipient is “in my CRM” is not the same as “they gave us permission to send
        them email marketing.”

        rates possible for all our customers, we do not allow businesses that offer these types of
        services, products, or content:

        data at our sole discretion to maintain a cost-effective service. We can not control and
        will not be liable for any effects of a third party service choosing to archive data on
        their servers.
