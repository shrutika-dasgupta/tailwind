Hi <?= $first_name; ?>,
<br /><br />
We've just finished calculating the historical data for your Pinterest profile, <strong><?= $username; ?></strong>.
<br /><br />
This history includes metrics for activity that happened before you signed up with Tailwind (<?= $signup_date; ?>).
Some of your historical metrics such as repin, like and follower counts have been <i>estimated</i> using trend data to give you the most accurate view possible.
<br /><br />
Your estimated historical data will appear as gray, dotted lines on your dashboard charts.
<br /><br />
