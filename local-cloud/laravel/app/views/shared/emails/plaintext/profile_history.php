Hi <?= $first_name; ?>,

We've just finished calculating the historical data for your Pinterest profile, <?= $username; ?>.

This history includes metrics for activity that happened before you signed up with Tailwind (<?= $signup_date; ?>).
Some of your historical metrics such as repin, like and follower counts have been estimated using trend data to give you the most accurate view possible.

Estimated historical data appears as gray, dotted lines on your dashboard charts.
